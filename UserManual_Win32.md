Make sure you set the Default Music Playback software prior to using the CuteABX tool

The Playback Software used and compared, tweaks on the OS and playback software if any, in the Digital Unit section, you can mention the DAC, Cables and any networking component used in between. In the rest you can mention the Amplifier (if separate) and the transducer. Optionally you can also mention the song and the release master used.
