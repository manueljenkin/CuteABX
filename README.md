The tool provides functions to Randomize and reduce the effect of timing difference proxies during the AB-X test.

The following is a set of guidelines when sharing results from the tests.

If you have not modified any part of the code other than the variables, then Feel free to copy paste the results, with the header mentioning the The Playback Software used and compared, tweaks on the OS and playback software if any, in the Digital Unit section, you can mention the DAC, Cables and any networking component used in between. In the rest you can mention the Amplifier (if separate) and the transducer. Optionally you can also mention the song and the release master used.
